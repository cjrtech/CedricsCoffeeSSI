       <h3>Customize Policy</h3>
       <p>We want our customers to feel that they are able to
        customize their coffee as much as they want to, while
        still maintaining a lower price than some of the 
        other coffee stores in the area. Coffee shops in the
        metro Detroit area charge extra for customization of
        their own. food and coffee which is ridiculous. 
        ridiculous. We want to offer the same price no matter
        what you add or take out of your food or beverage.</p>
