       <h3>About Us</h3>
       <p>Cedrics Coffee started in 2010 when the founder 'Cedric Rivera' wanted 
        something better than Starbucks for coffee every morning. So he decided
        to create his own coffee shop that has 5 locations and is expanding by the
        day. Cedric wants to expand to all reaches of metro Detroit area so that people.
        can enjoy whatever kind of coffee they want at a reasonable price.</p>
