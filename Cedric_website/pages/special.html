       <h3>Special Part About Us:</h3>
       <p>Around the world the earth is slowly being destroyed through the use of natural 
        gas, garbage, and waste of any kind. Here at Cedrics Coffee we believe in trying to
        make the world a better place and doing our part in controlling our waste as much
        as possible. We reuse and recycle all plastics, as well as use cups and straws that are
        biodegradable. At the end of every year we make a chart that shows how much we have
        saved in terms of reusing recycling, and using biodegradable products for our services.</p>
