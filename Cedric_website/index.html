      <h3>Cedrics Coffee</h3>
      <p>Cedrics Coffee started in 2010 when the founder 'Cedric Rivera' wanted 
         something better than Starbucks for coffee every morning. So he decided
         to create his own coffee shop that has 5 locations and is expanding by the
         day. Cedric wants to expand to all reaches of metro Detroit area so that people.
         can enjoy whatever kind of coffee they want at a reasonable price.</p>
      <p>We want our customers to feel that they are able to customize their coffee
         as much as they want to, while still maintaining a lower price than some of 
         the other coffee stores in the area. Coffee shops in the metro Detroit area
         charge extra for customization of their own. food and coffee which is ridiculous. 
         ridiculous. We want to offer the same price no matter what you add or take out of your food or beverage.</p>
